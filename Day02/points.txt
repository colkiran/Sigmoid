Packages and Modules
--------------------

what are packages and Modules?

Module - same as libraries in other technologies

in python, any python can be considered as a module


Package 
-------
packages are directories or folders where the modules are stored.


2.x
---
all packages should have a file  -> __init__.py (mandatory)


3.x
---
__init__.py is not mandatory



consume a module 
----------------
import mymodule	
---------------

1. If the module is present then creates a folder __pycache__, inside this folder it stores the compiled copy of the module -> mymodule.cpython-311.pyc

2. searches for module in environment paths

3. reads the .pth file from python native directory (folder where python.exe is present)

4. compares the date and time of creation or modification of .py file and .pyc file. python expects .pyc to have the latest date and time



Create a file with any name but the extension should be .pth (path file)

------------------------------------------------------

import mymodule
import mymodule as m

from mymodule import function
from mymodule import class

import mypackage.mymodule

from mypackage import * (__init__.py)
